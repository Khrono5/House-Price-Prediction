# House-Price-Prediction

The House_Price_Prediction_edited file is the jupyter notebook featuring the work I did in predicting house prices from the Ames, Iowa House price regression challenge data set from Kaggle.com. This data set was an excellent experience to perform different types of regression and compete against other analysts to see who could achieve better predictions.
